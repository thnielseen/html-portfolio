    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Therese Nielsen, Tess.</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! <br/>
        I'm Therese Nielsen, a biomedical laboratory scientist from Sweden with a newfound passion for web development. After exploring various disciplines within laboratory work for several years, I realized that my true calling lay in web development.

    <p> 
        In 2024, I made the decision to take the plunge and start the comprehensive 2024 Web development bootcamp online. My journey began on the 2nd of February 2024, and I'm excited to share it with you. Join me as I explore the exciting world of coding and web development!

    <p>
        Beyond my technical side, I'm also a creative soul. I love blending creative activities like knitting and jewelry making with my deep interest in dance. Whether it's bachata, kizomba, or salsa, dance allows me to express myself and let my creativity flow.
